# Surefire Test Fixer - Multi-Agent Approach

## Step 1: Analysis Sub-Agent
Use the `explore` sub-agent to:
- Read all Surefire XML reports in target/surefire-reports/
- Parse and summarize test results
- Categorize failures and skipped tests
- Create initial analysis report

Prompt: "Explore sub-agent: analyze all Surefire XML reports and create a summary"

## Step 2: Investigation Sub-Agent  
Use the `research` sub-agent to:
- Read failing test code
- Read implementation code
- Identify root causes
- Create detailed findings

Prompt: "Research sub-agent: investigate the root cause of each failed test"

## Step 3: Planning (Main Agent)
Main agent creates fix plan based on:
- Analysis from explore agent
- Findings from research agent
- Prioritization of fixes

## Step 4: Implementation Sub-Agent
Use `general-purpose` sub-agent for each fix:
- Implement the code change
- Run the specific test
- Verify the fix works
- Report results

Prompt: "Implement fix #1 from the plan and verify it works"
